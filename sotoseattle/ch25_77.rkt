; One way to look at it is from the stream of aa, I pick the first one, then I pick
; the first of dd, and finally I try to append ==> fail => try the next dd,......
; It would be sequential (flatuleno a aa) -> (flatuleno d dd) -> (appendo)
; That would be total DFS and it cannot be the solution because it would never end going through dd
;
; Another way would be to consider the streams in parallel, a la BFS
; I would combine an aa with all dd, and try appendo for each pair
; But then i) other solutions would show up before (a b . c) and ii) I would not get lost in infinity

; So, no idea yet...
