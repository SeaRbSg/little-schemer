### Conway's Game of Life (according to Javier Soto)

#### In Scheme

- Coded in Dr Racket (Racket lang)
- Purely functional and stateless
- 100% recursive
- Not very well tested, I am afraid
- Needs heavy refactoring, because it was coded in a single pass

To run open file in Dr. Racket and run.


#### Next Steps

- Man, refactor, it is embarrasing!
